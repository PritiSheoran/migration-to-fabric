## Lab 2: Migrate Azure Synapse Analytics SQL objects to Fabric Data Warehouse

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Overview

This lab focuses on migrating SQL objects and data from **Azure Synapse Analytics (Dedicated SQL Pool)** to **Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse**. It demonstrates how to create a warehouse in Fabric, establish a connection to Synapse, and use pipelines to copy data into OneLake. The lab also covers validating migrated data and scheduling pipelines for automated data movement.

## Review

In this lab, you successfully migrated data from Azure Synapse Analytics to Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse. You created a new warehouse, configured a pipeline with a Synapse SQL source, and loaded data into Fabric using OneLake. After executing the pipeline, you validated the data by comparing row counts between Synapse and Fabric. Finally, you scheduled the pipeline to automate recurring data transfers, ensuring a streamlined and scalable migration process.

## Congratulation! You have successfully completed this lab.
